  <p> What can you do?
  <br>
  <p> There is many things you can do while social distancing. You can do excersize. You can walk your dog(If you have one). You can play a online game with your friends. You can clean your house. You can work from home(if you have a job and are able to). You can learn how to cook. You can learn in general. Basically what I am saying is that there is many things you can do instead of just sitting in your home panicking wondering what could go wrong. You can even play bingo with your family over a zoom call.
