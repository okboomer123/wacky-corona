  <p> What have I been doing? What will I continue to do?
  <br>
  <p> Over intersession I have regularly doing excersizes like pushups and situps. I have gone outside multpiple times a day to take out trash or just to get some fresh air.
  I have done chores around my house like the loundry and taking out the trash. To not get bored I have been playing online video games and even played bingo over a zoom call 
  with my family. I am going to continue to do these things throughout the break and when we continue our actual school classes online. I feel like it is a good thing to keep
  myself occupied because I might get overwhelmed with stress or not very positive thoughts which I think will make this social distancing thing a lot harder.
